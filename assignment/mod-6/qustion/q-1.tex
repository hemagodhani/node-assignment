Q1. What is Middleware in Express.js?

     Middleware in Express.js is a function that can access the request and response objects
and can perform some action with them. Middleware functions can be used to modify the
request and response objects, execute some logic before forwarding the request to the 
next middleware in the chain or the final route handler, or return a response to the
client directly. Express.js supports the use of multiple middleware functions in a chain,
 allowing developers to add a series of actions to be taken for a given request.
