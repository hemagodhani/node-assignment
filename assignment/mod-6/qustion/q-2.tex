Q2. What is json web tokens?

    JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred
between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is 
digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS) and/or encrypted using JSON Web 
Encryption (JWE). JWTs are often used to securely transmit information between
parties, such as an API client and server, and are commonly used for authentication 
and authorization purposes.
