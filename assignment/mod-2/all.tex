   Callback is an asynchronous equivalent for a function. It is called
at the completion of each task.Using Callback concept, Node.js can 
process a large number of requests without waiting for any function to
return the result which makes Node.js highly scalable.


Q3.What are the advantages of using promises instead of callbacks?
   -> They are composable, unlike callbacks, therefore we can avoid 
      callback hells.
   -> You can easily execute code with Promise.all when multiple 
      responses are returned.
   -> You can wait for only one result from concurrent pending promises
      with the help of Promise.race
   -> You can write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner if you
      use it in conjunction with async / await.


Q4.What is NPM?
   NPM stands for Node Package Manager and is one of the multiple 
package managers (others include Yarn, Bower, etc.) available for the 
Javascript programming language. Furthermore, itâ€™s the default package
manager for Node.js.
